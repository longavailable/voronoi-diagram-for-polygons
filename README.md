[Voronoi diagram for polygons] is a tool to create a [Voronoi diagram] also known as [Thiessen polygons] for **polygons**. It's based on [Shapely] and [GeoPandas]. There are lots of tools to create a [Voronoi diagram] for points, for example [Create Thiessen Polygons (Analysis)] in [ArcGIS Pro] or [ArcGIS Desktop], [Voronoi Polygons] in [QGIS], or [voronoi_diagram] in [Shapely]. All of them are really cool. How about a [Voronoi diagram] for polygons? That's what this tool does.

## Installation, update and uninstallation

### Dependencies

***Important!*** It's based on `voronoi_diagram` from [Shapely] which is new in version 1.8.dev0. As of today, it is still a developing version. *(2020-07-26)* You have to install or upgrade to the latest developing version from source firstly:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely
```

```bash
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely
```

### To install

Quick installation with `pip`:
```bash
pip install voronoi-diagram-for-polygons
```
Or from github:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/longavailable/voronoi-diagram-for-polygons
```
Also, you can just copy related functions from *[longsgis/longsgis.py]* to your work.

### To update

```bash
pip install --upgrade voronoi-diagram-for-polygons
```

### To uninstall

```bash
pip uninstall voronoi-diagram-for-polygons
```

## Usage

See *[tests/01voronoiDiagram4plg.py]*.
```python
import geopandas as gpd
from longsgis import voronoiDiagram4plg

builtup = gpd.read_file('input.geojson'); builtup.crs = 32650
boundary = gpd.read_file('boundary.geojson'); boundary.crs = 32650
vd = voronoiDiagram4plg(builtup, boundary)
vd.to_file('output.geojson', driver='GeoJSON')
```

## FAQ

- I/O support.

	It was noticed someone were struggled with the input/output files with a format of `.geojson` (https://github.com/longavailable/voronoi-diagram-for-polygons/issues/3, https://github.com/longavailable/voronoi-diagram-for-polygons/issues/5). Actually, that's not a question related to this package. I will explain more here about it. This package is totally based on [GeoPandas]. In other words, any format that can be converted to `geopandas.GeoDataFrame` object is supported. As the [official documentation](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/user_guide/io.html#reading-spatial-data) said:

	> geopandas can read almost any vector-based spatial data format including ESRI shapefile, GeoJSON files and more using the command: `geopandas.read_file()`
	
	That means, you can put your `.shp` files as inputs and output as well. Any format you'd like. I used a few geojson-s (`input.geojson`, `boundary.geojson`, and `output.geojson`) in my example because the geojson format is very open. However, it's NOT necessary.
	
	For more, I upload the [input.geojson] and [boundary.geojson] files. Hope they helps. For the sake of caution, I declare here that they are only a test file, any actual geographical data, similar or not, I have no guarantee to the accuracy and authenticity for them.

## Known shortages

- It may produce multipolygons (consisted by some unconnected polygons) around the boundary.

- Special input may cause overlap. See the following:

	</p>
	
	*To avoid this, I recommend reasonable preprocessing of the input, but use a buffer operation with high-resolution carefully.* A buffer operation with high-resolution will result in circular arcs, which will generate too many vertices in a local area. This may trigger other bugs. In my practices, the following code snippet worked well.
	
```python
def bufferDissolve(gdf, distance, join_style=3):	
	'''Create buffer and dissolve thoese intersects.
	
	Parameters:
		gdf: 
			Type: geopandas.GeoDataFrame
		distance: radius of the buffer
			Type: float
	Returns:
		gdf_bf: buffered and dissolved GeoDataFrame
			Type: geopandas.GeoDataFrame
	'''
	#create buffer and dissolve by invoking `unary_union`
	smp = gdf.buffer(distance, join_style).unary_union
	#convert to GeoSeries and explode to single polygons
	gs = gpd.GeoSeries([smp]).explode()
	#convert to GeoDataFrame
	gdf_bf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(geometry=gs, crs=gdf.crs).reset_index(drop=True)
	return gdf_bf
```
